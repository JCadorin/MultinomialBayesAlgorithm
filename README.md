# TextClassifier
Text Classifier using Multinomial Bayes Algorithm.


# [OBJECTIVE]

 People are sharing a lot of information on internet, and categorize them is very helpful to give priority to what is really important and distinguish it from what don't have the right relevance for the moment. A way to automate this kind of process is using the Multinomial Naive Bayes, an algorithm that calculate the probability to something happen due to an event ocurred previously. 
 
 # [PROJECT]
 
  The code made in python was separate in three differents .py files, one with the class definition, with all the function, one where we find the train and the test data we work, and the last with the executable function.
  
  # [CONCLUSION]
  
   The multinomial Na√Øve Bayes is a great feature to work effectively with text classifier having a great accuracy rate even with small sample sizes datasets, it can be used for spam filtering, categorizing text or sentiment analysis. In our first test, even with just a few texts used to train our model, we acchieved the 100% of accurancy in our five texts test dataset.
